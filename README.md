# Further-Machine-Learning-Projects
This repo will include projects about, to name a few:
- Data Cleaning
- Natural Language Processing
- Reinforcement Learning
- Gradient Descent w/ Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Clustering Implementations
- Boosting Algorithms
- Time Series Data Analysis

The goal after this repo is to be able to tackle a complete data analysis project from start to finish (all phases: processing, storing, visualization, analysis and modelling). Another repo for the programming language 'R' will be created soon. I will also try to upload clean datasets on Kaggle, wish me luck.
