# Further-Machine-Learning-Projects
This repo will include projects specifically about:
- Data Cleaning
- Web Crawling w/ Beautiful Soup
- Reinforcement Learning
- Recommender Systems
- Gradient Descent w/ Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- K-Means


On this Repo, I will try to do more visualization and data cleaning. The goal after this repo is to be able to tackle a complete data analysis project from start to finish (all phases: processing, storing, visualization, analysis and modelling). I will also try to upload clean datasets on Kaggle, wish me luck

## Step 1:
First step would be to become more handy when it comes to data cleaning. A folder will be uploaded specifically for notebooks that involve cleaning datasets.

## Step 2:
