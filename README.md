# Further-Machine-Learning-Projects
This repo will include projects specifically about:
- Data Cleaning
- Web Crawling w/ Beautiful Soup
- Reinforcement Learning
- Recommender Systems
- Gradient Descent w/ Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- KMeans

On this Repo, I will try to do more visualization and data cleaning. The goal after this repo is to be able to tackle a complete data analysis project from start to finish (all phases: processing, storing, visualization, analysis and modelling). Wish me luck
